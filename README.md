## World-Gymnast: Training Robots with Reinforcement Learning in a World Model

</div>

**World-Gymnast** fine-tunes vision-language-action policies by rolling out actions in a learned world model and scoring imagined trajectories with a vision-language model. It improves real-robot performance, supports training with distractors and novel language, and enables test-time training plus iterative world-model updates.
